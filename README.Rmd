## Demo

Try the app at **https://connect.thinkr.fr/signature/**

## Try locally

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ThinkR-open/signature")
```

then: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
signature::run_app()
```

## Description

This application offers a **graphical interface** to **simplify the creation and/or maintenance of your email signature**. 

No more struggling with images or getting lost in the HTML code, the application offers a series of inputs to update the signature. 

Enter your name, first name, email and other information to fill in your signature.

This application also proposes to **copy the HTML code** via a button in order to **paste it in the parameters of your mailbox**.

Finally, the banner (image at the bottom of the signature) and the redirection by clicking on it are easy to update. No more asking everyone to update their signature to update the banner and the redirection.


Now you just have to :  
- modify the image stored in this repo to update the banner  
- modify the link of the html file at the root of the project

## How to update the signature?

### The banner

To update the banner image, replace the `current_banner.png` with a new image with the same name.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
fs::dir_tree(path = "inst/app/www/templates/thinkr/assets")
```

### The redirection url

To update the redirection url, modify the `script` inside `index.html` at the root of the package:

```{html}
<script>
  window.location.replace("https://thinkr.fr/blog/");
</script>
```

### The look of the signature

To change the look of the signature more generally, you need to modify the HTML inside `template.html`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
fs::dir_tree(path = "inst/app/www/templates/thinkr")
```
